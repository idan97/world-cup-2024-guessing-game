# Mission 11 â€“ What-If Simulation Endpoint

**Goal:**
Implement the simulation endpoint to allow users to run what-if scenarios without affecting the real leaderboard.

## Checklist

- [ ] Implement `POST /simulate` endpoint
- [ ] Use scoring logic to simulate leaderboard with overrides
- [ ] Ensure simulation does not alter DB state

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can simulate rankings with custom overrides
- Real leaderboard/data is not changed
